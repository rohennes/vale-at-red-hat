Consider aggregating alerts to identify the most common. Examine the report to distinguish legit alerts from false positives. Use the curated list of false positives to report an issue.

Use that list to differentiate false positives from legit errors. Use the curated list to report an issue.

To use the OpenShiftAsciiDoc style, do the following: Update your project .vale.ini to include the the OpenShiftAsciiDoc style. Add OpenShiftAsciiDoc to the Packages and BasedOnStyles fields. For example: Example .vale.ini StylesPath = .vale/styles MinAlertLevel = suggestion Packages = RedHat, OpenShiftAsciiDoc # Ignore files in dirs starting with `.` to avoid raising errors for `.vale/fixtures/*/testinvalid.adoc` files [[!.]*.adoc] BasedOnStyles = RedHat, OpenShiftAsciiDoc Some rules are applicable to modules only. To use a different set of rules for modules and assemblies, create two .vale.ini files, one in the project root, and one in the /modules folder. For the root .vale.ini file, add the following to disable rules that don’t apply to assemblies: # Disable module specific rules OpenShiftAsciiDoc.ModuleContainsParentAssemblyComment = NO OpenShiftAsciiDoc.NoNestingInModules = NO OpenShiftAsciiDoc.NoXrefInModules = NO Sync your project that contains the updated .vale.ini configuration, for example: Open a shell prompt and change to the project directory: $ cd Run the sync command to pull the new Rule packages $ vale sync Example output SUCCESS Downloaded package 'RedHat' SUCCESS Downloaded package 'OpenShiftAsciiDoc' Downloading packages [2/2] ██████████████████ 100% | 3s The Vale at Red Hat repository contains the OpenShiftAsciiDoc style in the following directory: .vale/styles/OpenShiftAsciiDoc Additional resources Installing Vale Using Vale in the IDE Integrating Vale into your Git workflow by using a GitHub Action Adding Vale to a project","title":"OpenShift AsciiDoc style for Vale","component":"docs","version":"main","name":"openshift-asciidoc-style-for-vale","url":"/docs/main/user-guide/openshift-asciidoc-style-for-vale/","titles":[]},"50":{"id":50,"text":"The RedHat style for Vale consists of language rules suitable for documentation in Open Source projects and mandatory for Red Hat products.
